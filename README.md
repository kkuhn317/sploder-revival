# sploder-revival

PHP Backend code used to power the Sploder Revival.

## Flash & Security Notice

In order to use the Sploder Revival (in a usable state, not via [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/)), you will need to install a working version of Flash Player. We recommend downloading either of these:

- [CleanFlash](https://gitlab.com/cleanflash/installer) A modified Chinese Flash Player without adware. Flash in China still receives security updates for Windows and macOS.
- [Adobe Flash Player](https://archive.org/details/flashplayer_old) Official version of Flash Player available in all other regions. No longer updated after December of 2020.

As well as a Flash/CleanFlash compatible browser:

- [Waterfox Classic](https://classic.waterfox.net/)
- [Pale Moon](https://www.palemoon.org/)
- [K-Meleon](http://kmeleonbrowser.org/forum/read.php?19,154431)

Note that Flash has been discontinued since January 2021, and that using a Flash compatible browser and Flash itself should be exercised with caution outside of Sploder Revival usage.

## Prerequisites

To run the Sploder Revival, you will need to ensure you have the following installed:

Also, to ensure formatting is done correctly, please run `make dev.hook` to install the necessary hooks as well as `composer install`.

Further, whenever you have updated the schema of the database, please run `make dev.backup.db`, which will update the schema of the database from the Dockerfile. If you are running an manual installation, please ensure you run the following Postgres command into `/db/sploder.sql` when you update the database: `pg_dump -U sploder_owner -d sploder --format=p --schema-only --create > /db/sploder.sql`

## Running

### Docker

The provided Makefile provides an easy to use interface for running the development docker compose files.

First, you need to build the image.

```shell
make build # build the sploder-image
```

After this, you will want to make sure you bootstrap the database for local development. This only needs to be ran once, or can be re-ran if you manually delete the database information.

If you run dev.bootstrap, it will also create two users: `test` and `test2`, with the password `password`.

For development, the following commands will let you run the instance locally
```shell
make dev.bootstrap # RUN ONCE: bootstraps the backup database while inserting test data
make dev # Runs the dev docker compose, detaching the container
make dev.watch # Runs the dev docker compose
```

For production, the following commands will let you run the instance in production
```shell
make prod.bootstrap # RUN ONCE: bootstraps the backup schema only
make prod # Runs the production docker compose
```

### Manual

If executing a manual deployment, be sure to copy `.env.example` to `./src/.env` and populate the values with the specified configuration.
