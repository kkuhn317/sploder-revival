            <h5>Limitation of Liability</h5>

            <p class="note">Sploder Revival will do everything it can to make the use of this system a pleasant
                one. However, it must always

                remain true that you expressly understand and agree that under no circumstances shall Sploder
                Revival be liable to any

                user on account of that user's use of or reliance on this service. Such limitation of liability shall
                apply to

                prevent recovery of direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, and punitive
                damages.

                Such limitation of liability shall apply whether the damages arise from use or misuse of and reliance on
                this

                service, from inability to use the service, or from the interruption, suspension, or termination of the
                service.</p>



            <h5>Guarantees</h5>

            <p class="note">Sploder Revival will do everything it can to make sure that the integrity of your
                data on Sploder Revival remains intact.

                However, Sploder Revival <em>cannot</em> be held liable for <em>any</em> loss of data.</p>



            <h5>Service Scope and Usage</h5>



            <p class="note">Sploder Revival's servers do not have unlimited bandwidth. Bandwidth limitations apply for
                all users. Users may not post games hosted on Sploder Revival's servers in such a fashion that the same
                game is repeated multiple times on the same

                page, nor needlessly repeated on many pages of a site. This includes bulletin-board sig-files and sites'
                global navigation. This causes

                repeated, redundant, and sometimes concurrent downloads from Sploder Revival's servers, and quickly uses
                up bandwidth.</p>



            <p class="note">If a user uses the system in such a way to adversely effect the performance or efficient
                operation of the site,

                Sploder Revival reserves the right to terminate the user's account. Users must not attempt to
                circumvent the security and

                privacy systems in place, or attempt to hack the system.</p>



            <p class="note">Sploder Revival reserves the right to terminate service to you if you do not meet
                these terms. Sploder Revival will also cooperate with authorities through its respective service
                providers.</p>



            <p class="note">Sploder Revival cannot be held responsible for limitations placed on the system by
                its service providers at the <a href="../credits.php">credits</a> list. This website runs
                <em>purely</em> on donations and runs <em>no advertisements</em> in any fashion. All donations are used
                to improve the quality of our service.
