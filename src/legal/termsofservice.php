                remain true that you expressly understand and agree that under no circumstances shall Sploder
                Revival&trade; be liable to any

                damages.

            <h5>Service Scope and Usage</h5>



            <p class="note">Sploder Revival's servers do not have unlimited bandwidth. Bandwidth limitations apply for
                all users. Users may not post games hosted on Sploder Revival's servers in such a fashion that the same
                game is repeated multiple times on the same

                page, nor needlessly repeated on many pages of a site. This includes bulletin-board sig-files and sites'
                global navigation. This causes

                repeated, redundant, and sometimes concurrent downloads from Sploder Revival's servers, and quickly uses
                up bandwidth.</p>



            <p class="note">If a user uses the system in such a way to adversely effect the performance or efficient
                operation of the site,

                Sploder Revival&trade; reserves the right to terminate the user's account. Users must not attempt to
                circumvent the security and

                privacy systems in place, or attempt to hack the system.</p>



            <p class="note">Sploder Revival&trade; reserves the right to terminate service to you if you do not meet
                these terms. Sploder Revival&trade; will also cooperate with authorities through its respective service
                providers.</p>



            <p class="note">Sploder Revival&trade; cannot be held responsible for limitations placed on the system by
                its service providers at the <a href="../credits.php">credits</a> list. This website runs
                <em>purely</em> on donations and runs <em>no advertisements</em> in any fasion. All donations are used
